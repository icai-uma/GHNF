# GHNF Demos (MATLAB)
This repository contains several MATLAB demos illustrating different functionalities of the GHNF model ([link](https://www.mdpi.com/3584042)), including clustering, vector quantization, and self-organization methods.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020b or later recommended)
- No additional toolboxes are required unless specified inside each script.

## How to Run
Each demo can be executed directly from the MATLAB command window.
Simply run:
```
ghnf_demo_X
```
where X can be one of the following options:
- clustering
- clustering2
- quantization
- self_organization
- self_organization2
- self_organization3

Example:
```
ghnf_demos_clustering
```
Each script loads its own data (if needed) and produces visualizations or console outputs illustrating the behavior of the corresponding method.
